# RefWrite

Tool for automated letter of reference generation with the OpenAI GPT API.

## Wireframes

Wireframes were designed in Figma. Essentially we wanted a landing page that would be run as a separate static web page. This would link to our MERN stack app running on a different server. Wireframes can be viewed [here](https://www.figma.com/file/ceu4ags4enO3UtxS6gn7es/RefWrite-Wireframes?node-id=0%3A1). A small preview is shown below for some of the pages.
